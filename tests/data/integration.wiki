!Butterfly Basics

This article outlines how to use the Butterfly wiki syntax. It's 
pretty similar to most other wiki syntaxes (like [http://wikipedia.org/|MediaWiki]), 
but tries to improve on it whenever I felt like it.

!!Headers
To make a header, start a line with an exclamation point (==!==).

 !!!I am an <h3> tag!

produces

!!!I am an <h3> tag!

!!Paragraphs
Two successive line breaks is a paragraph. Paragraphs are also created 
by single line breaks after closing certain scopes (like, e.g. a 
header).

{{{[!Hello

world]}}}

produces

Hello

world

!!Text
Basic textual manipulation.

!!!Bold
Bold text is surrounded by two successive underscores (==[!__]==).

 [!__this text will be bold__, but this text will not.]

produces

__this text will be bold__, but this text will not.

!!!Italics
Italic text is surrounded by two successive apostrophes (==[!'']==).

 [!''this text will be italicized'', but this text will not.]

produces

''this text will be bold'', but this text will not.

!!!Teletype
Teletype text is surrounded by two successive equals signs (==[!==]==).

 [!==this text will be teletype==, but this text will not.]

produces

==this text will be teletype==, but this text will not.

!!!Underline
Underlined text is surrounded by two successive dashes (==[!--]==).

 [!--this text will be underlined--, but this text will not.]

produces

--this text will be underlined--, but this text will not.

!!!Strike-through
Strike-through text is surrounded by three successive dashes (==[!---]==).

 [!---this text will be strike-through---, but this text will not.]

produces

---this text will be strike-through---, but this text will not.

!!!Small
Smaller text starts with ==[!(-]== and ends with ==[!-)]==.

 [!(-this text will be (-even smaller-)-), but this text will not.]

produces

(-this text will be (-even smaller-)-), but this text will not.

!!!Big
Bigger text starts with ==[!(+]== and ends with ==[!+)]==.

 [!(+this text will be (+even bigger+)+), but this text will not.]

produces

(+this text will be (+even bigger+)+), but this text will not.

!!Links
Links are an important part of wikis. There are four different ways 
to represent links in Butterfly:

#A wiki link with default text
#*==[![foo]]]== -> [foo]
#A wiki link with alternate text
#*==[![foo|bar]]]== -> [foo|bar]
#An external link with default text
#*==[![http://example.com/]]]== -> [http://example.com/]
#An external link with alternate text
#*==[![http://example.com/|external link]]]== -> [http://example.com/|external link]

!!Lists
Lists are also important. They should be overused at all times.

!!!Bullet Lists
{{{[!*List 1
*List 2
**Sub list 2-1
**Sub list 2-2
**#Sub list 2-2-1
**#Sub list 2-2-2
**Sub list 2-3
*List 3
*#Sub list 3-1
*#Sub list 3-2
*List 4]}}}

produces

*List 1
*List 2
**Sub list 2-1
**Sub list 2-2
**#Sub list 2-2-1
**#Sub list 2-2-2
**Sub list 2-3
*List 3
*#Sub list 3-1
*#Sub list 3-2
*List 4

!!!Definition Lists
Start a line with a semicolon for terms, start a line with a 
colon for definitions.

{{{[!;Term
:Definition
;Elephant
:Grey, long trunk, enormous in stature]}}}

produces

;Term
:Definition
;Elephant
:Grey, long trunk, enormous in stature
