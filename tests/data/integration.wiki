!Butterfly Basics

This article outlines how to use the Butterfly wiki syntax. It's 
pretty similar to most other wiki syntaxes (like [http://wikipedia.org/|MediaWiki]), 
but tries to improve on it whenever I felt like it.

!!Text
Basic textual manipulation.

!!!Bold
Bold text is surrounded by two successive underscores (==[!__]==).

 [!__this text will be bold__, but this text will not.]

produces

__this text will be bold__, but this text will not.

!!!Italics
Italic text is surrounded by two successive apostrophes (==[!'']==).

 [!''this text will be italicized'', but this text will not.]

produces

''this text will be bold'', but this text will not.

!!!Teletype
Teletype text is surrounded by two successive equals signs (==[!==]==).

 [!==this text will be teletype==, but this text will not.]

produces

==this text will be teletype==, but this text will not.

!!!Underline
Underlined text is surrounded by two successive dashes (==[!--]==).

 [!--this text will be underlined--, but this text will not.]

produces

--this text will be underlined--, but this text will not.

!!!Strike-through
Strike-through text is surrounded by three successive dashes (==[!---]==).

 [!---this text will be strike-through---, but this text will not.]

produces

---this text will be strike-through---, but this text will not.

!!!Small
Smaller text starts with ==[!(-]== and ends with ==[!-)]==.

 [!(-this text will be (-even smaller-)-), but this text will not.]

produces

(-this text will be (-even smaller-)-), but this text will not.

!!!Big
Bigger text starts with ==[!(+]== and ends with ==[!+)]==.

 [!(+this text will be (+even bigger+)+), but this text will not.]

produces

(+this text will be (+even bigger+)+), but this text will not.
